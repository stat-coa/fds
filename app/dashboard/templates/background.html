    <p><span>The Food (New Taiwan) dollar series measures annual expenditures by Taiwan consumers on domestically produced food. This data series is composed of three primary series—the marketing bill series, the industry group series, and the primary factor series—that describe different aspects of the food supply chain. The Food Dollar Series provides an overview of the food system, with informative estimates of the farm share and the distribution of value-added shares of each dollar spent on food over time.</span></p>
    <p><span>Marketing bill statistics for food commodities have been published annually since the 1940s by USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS). The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 mandated that USDA measure the cost of marketing U.S. agricultural commodities. ERS replaced the marketing bill series with the Food Dollar Series in 2011. This was due to measurement problems, the discontinuation of several underlying data sources, and increased interest in evolving supply chain relationships.</span></p>
    <p><span>According to the report of ERS, Statistics Office of Council of Agriculture(COA) complied the Food Dollar Series in 2022 The Food Dollar Series uses input-output (IO) analysis to calculate the food dollar and its components for the years 1981 to 2016. The series is updated annually.</span></p>
    <p><span>Input-output analysis generates food dollar estimates (and food and beverage dollar estimates) for food expenditure, and three primary dollar series are generated:</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>The marketing bill series splits the food dollar into the farm share and the marketing share. The farm share is the portion of the food dollar that goes to farm establishments for the sales of raw food commodities. The marketing share is the portion of the food dollar that goes to food supply chain establishments for post-farm activities that transform raw food into finished food products.</span></li>
        <li><span>Because the market value of all food dollar expenditures equals the value added by all food supply chain industries, the industry group series divides the food dollar into total value added for 12 industry groups: agribusiness; farm production; food processing; packaging; transportation services; energy; wholesale trade; retail trade; foodservices; finance and insurance; advertising; as well as legal and accounting services.</span></li>
        <li><span>The primary factor series divides the food dollar into the value contributions of four primary production-factor groups—Compensation, Operating Surplus, Consumption of Fixed Capital, Net Taxes and Imports. Then a cross tabulation table divides the food dollar into the primary-factor returns for each industry group. All estimates are reported in nominal (current price) dollars.</span></li>

    <p><strong><span>Q:</span></strong><span> What are the Input-Output Tables? What are the Supply-Use Tables? What is the difference between IOTs and SUTs?</span></p>
    <p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> The main differences between SUTs and IOTs are as follows:</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Scope: The supply table of SUTs presents the product mix produced by domestic industries, and the status of each product from domestic industries and imports. The use table reflects the cost structure of each industry, the final use of each product by the department, and the flow of each product. IOTs is similar with use table, and the supply side only show the domestic output and imports.</span></li>
        <li><span>Compiling process: SUTs are produced for Commodity-by-Industry(CxI) based on source data. IOTs are converted into Commodity-by-Commodity(CxC) transaction tables based on source data and technical assumptions.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><span>Q:</span></strong><span> What is the release periodicity of the Input-Output Tables and Supply-Use Tables?</span></p>
    <p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> It depends on Benchmark year / Non-Benchmark year.</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Benchmark year</span>
        <span>The Benchmark IO tables(IOTs) and Supply and Use tables(SUTs) are produced according to result of the Industry and Service Census Survey every 5 years (ending in ‘1’ or ’6’). The Benchmark tables in matrix form are the most detailed accounts.</span></li>
        <li><span>Non-Benchmark year</span>
        <span>The annual SUTs are compiled according to the national income accounts and related information every year. Owing to the relatively fewer data resource, the annual tables are produced based on purchaser’s price and classified as 63 Commodity-by-Industry accounts.</span></li>

    <p><strong><span>Q:</span></strong><span> Why ERS revise the Food Dollar Series?</span></p>
    <p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> All tables in the Food Dollar Series were automatically revised from 2008 forward, with the integration of new Industry Economic </span><a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/economic-accounts/industry#annual"><span>Input-Output Accounts</span></a><span> for 2012. The reasons and methodology used by ERS for this planned revision are described in the following ERS report:</span></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=44827"><span>A Revised and Expanded Food Dollar Series: A Better Understanding of Our Food Costs</span></a></p>
    <p><span>Since the release of this report, ERS implemented minor, but important, improvements in the estimation model used to develop all annual food dollar statistics. The improvements address some inconsistencies in the way that standard input-output (IO) accounts represent the U.S. food system, such as how food-away-from-home expenditures at non-conventional eating places—e.g., sports arenas and passenger travel—are traced through the food supply chain and how wholesale and retail establishments in the food industry are distinguished from other trade establishments. The combined changes to the estimation model had little or no impact on some estimates. However, in many cases, changes resulted in both upward and downward revisions in the historical data series.</span></p>
    <p><strong><span>Q:</span></strong><span> Why replace the marketing bill series?</span></p>

    <ul>
        <li><span>The quality, timeliness, and completeness of the source data ensure a complete accounting of the entire food system is derived from a single consolidated data source;</span></li>
        <li><span>A precise approach to measuring and reporting the cost components of the entire food dollar in the current series avoids the potentially confusing divisions of the previous marketing bill series; and</span></li>
        <li><span>The current Food Dollar Series provides a more complete accounting of the modern global food system. For more information, see:</span></li>

    <p><strong><span>Q:</span></strong><span> How does the marketing bill series differ from price spreads data?</span></p>
    <p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> The marketing bill series answers the question: “What is the average price received over a calendar year by farmers for the farm commodities produced for a typical $1 consumer food purchase, and how has this average price changed over time?” The series provides an average across all food and beverage products combined and includes both purchases in retail food stores—such as supermarkets—and purchases in foodservice establishments—such as restaurants. Statistics are reported in both a current-year (nominal) price series and a real-price series holding all prices constant at their reference year levels with the current reference year being 2012. Because all food purchases from domestic production are considered, the mix of products represented, or the market basket changes year-to-year.</span></p>
    <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/price-spreads-from-farm-to-consumer/"><span>Price Spreads from Farm to Consumer</span></a><span> data product also compares prices paid by consumers for food with prices received by farmers for corresponding commodities, but comparisons are for various foods sold only through retail food stores. Prices are reported as a calendar year average and comparisons of farm and retail prices are made for individual foods and groupings of individual foods—market baskets—representing what a typical U.S. household buys at retail in a given year. The retail costs of these baskets are compared with the money received by farmers for a corresponding basket of agricultural commodities. Food groupings currently include dairy, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, processed fruits and vegetables, and field crops—with each food group encompassing two or more individual food items.</span></p>
